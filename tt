the problem im facing now is, i have dockerize wordpress, nginx, mariadb, all containers are working well, but when i try localhost on my browser it is redirecting me to nginx, i want it to redirect me to wordpress page, where is the problem
this is all i did in nginx service
docker file:
FROM debian:buster

RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install nginx -y
RUN apt-get install openssl -y

COPY  ./conf/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/
COPY  ./keys/s.crt /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
COPY  ./keys/p.key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key

EXPOSE 443

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
and here is the nginx configuration
events{

}

http{
    server {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name localhost;
        root /var/www/html/wordpress;

        index index.php;

        ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location ~ .php$ {
            try_files $uri =404;
            fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+.php)(/.+)$;
            fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
        }
    }
}
and i have added those two files containd private key and other one end certificate
and here is what a did in mariadb service
i created database manually .sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS wordpress;
CREATE USER 'hbouqssi'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON wordpress.* to 'hbouqssi'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '0000';
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' identified by '0000';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
and i have copying the conf file to it's place by changind bind to 0.0.0.0
and this is the docker file for mariabdb
COPY ./tools/script.sh /

RUN chmod +x ./script.sh

RUN ./script.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["mysqld"]
and here is the script
#!/bin/bash

service mysql start
mysql < /mydb.sql
rm -f /mydb.sql
and about wordpress i did this in dockerfile
FROM debian:buster

RUN apt update -y && apt install php-cgi php-mysql -y

RUN apt update && apt install curl -y

COPY ./tools/script.sh /

RUN chmod +x ./script.sh

CMD ["/script.sh"]
and the script 
#!bin/bash

echo "Installing Wp-cli ..."

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
mv /wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
rm -rf wp-cli.phar
mkdir /var/www/ && mkdir /var/www/html &&  cd /var/www/html/
wp core download --allow-root
mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
wp config set DB_NAME "wordpress" --allow-root
wp config set DB_USER "hbouqssi" --allow-root
wp config set DB_PASSWORD "0000" --allow-root
exec "$@"
and here is my docker compose
